### Description

An problem I've had multiple times when creating
[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) apps is that I'd like to
transition something in and out depending on their mount status. A router for
example, that can transition pages in and out, or an image slideshow where you'd
simply change the source of the image. Ever since
[react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group)
updated to API v2 all my existing solutions for this problem failed. I made this
example for reference using the new API.

### Development mode

To start the Figwheel compiler, navigate to the project folder and run the following command in the terminal:

```
lein figwheel
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.
Once Figwheel starts up, you should be able to open the `public/index.html` page in the browser.
